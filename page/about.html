        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am an Undergraduate at university, studying for a BSc in Computer Science. <br> I have an interest in software development, front-end web development, data analytics and AI. <br> Anything digital, I am all over it. <br> <br> I'm originally from Nottingham, and while being a traditional computer nerd, I'm very much an Elle Woods type - I can code well, and look fab doing it üíÅ.<br> <br> Outside of tech, I like working on graphic design projects, interior design, playing Pokemon games, and learning to play guitar.</p>
