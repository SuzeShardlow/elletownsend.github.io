        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p>I am an Undergraduate at university, studying for a BSc in Computer Science. <br> <br> I regularly attend hackathons, workshops and conferences. In 2019, I was part of the winning team at <a href="/page/custodian.html">CatalystHack</a>, in which we developed a game to encourage more young women into STEM. <br> <br> Outside of my tech, I like graphic design, video games and reading, I am also an aspiring speaker and blogger.</p>
