        <h1>CUSTODIAN - CATALYSTHACK 2019</h1>
        <p>In April 2019, I attended CatalystHack, an all female and non-binary hackathon to inspire the next generation of girls in STEM, sponsored by Rolls Royce. We were encouraged to focus our ingenuity to use tech to help solve a social issue - the STEM gender gap. </p>
        <p>On The first day, I got to know some of the other women attending the event, and made up a group - Team 15! <br> We were tasked with creating a prototype and idea behind a game that could be used to encourage more young women to get involved with STEM subjects. We came up with 'Custodian', a game where the main character has to brings life back to a world devastated by climate change and deforestation, through nourishing the environment and taking care of the remaining animals. </p>
        <p>After 24 hours working on our prototype, we presented our ideas to the judges and Custodian was given first prize!</p>
        <p>It was my first hackathon experience, and it a lot of fun coming up with our idea and bringing it to life, with guidance from some lovely people at Bossa Studios. <br> <br>
